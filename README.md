## Overview

This interactive workshop tool helps learners understand and apply the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** in clinical scenarios. It allows users to calculate:
- **pH**
- **Bicarbonate (HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª)**
- **pCO‚ÇÇ**

Each calculation comes with step-by-step explanations, example values, a quiz prompt, and clinical relevance summaries ‚Äî making it ideal for classroom use, self-study, or medical training sessions.

## Features

- Select from three calculation types: pH, HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª, or pCO‚ÇÇ
- Load example cases (e.g., respiratory acidosis, metabolic alkalosis)
- Step-by-step breakdown of each calculation
- Built-in quiz prompts for learning reinforcement
- Clinical relevance provided for interpretation and context
- Responsive, browser-based design ‚Äî no installation required

## Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

The core equation used in this tool is:

pH = 6.1 + log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ([HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª] / (0.03 √ó pCO‚ÇÇ))

The equation is rearranged internally depending on the user‚Äôs choice of unknown variable.
